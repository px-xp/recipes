    title: Savory Apple Sage Turkey Sausages
    description: Pair this classic sweet and savory flavor combination with oats or eggs for a hearty, high-protein breakfast. You can also toss these in a wrap for lunch, or eat them on the go for a satisfying snack. Lean turkey is high in protein, and apple provides a sweet balance to the more savory flavors.
